                  At their best, The Avett Brothers are transcendent songwriters
                  with the ability to cut right to the soul while delivering
                  perfect musical harmony.

        <h2>THEIR TIMELINE</h2>
        <h3>2000–2002</h3>
        <p>
          Scott and Seth Avett have played music together since childhood as
          their grandmother was a concert pianist and their father Jim Avett was
          a guitarist. Their collaborative partnership began in the late 1990s
          with the merger of Seth's Mount Pleasant High School rock band Margo
          and Scott's college group Nemo.After releasing three albums with Nemo,
          the Avetts started experimenting with acoustic music with some friends
          at night. After a few street performances and parties they performed
          under the names The Back Porch Project or Nemo Downstairs. <br />
          The brothers and Nemo guitarist John Twomey put together an EP
          entitled The Avett Bros in 2000 while performing both as the Avett
          Brothers (with Scott, Seth and John) and as Nemo. When Nemo broke up
          Scott and Seth continued to write acoustic music together. <br />
          In early 2001 the stand-up bassist Bob Crawford, formerly of the
          Memphis Quick 50, joined the Avetts, and the band released their first
          full-length album, Country Was. The Avett Brothers set out on a
          self-booked tour to promote the new album and in late 2002 began
          preparations for a follow-up.
        </p>
        <h3>2003–2006</h3>
        <p>
          After releasing a live album of original songs and covers entitled
          Live at the Double Door Inn the brothers settled down to compile a new
          full-length album. After 70 hours in the studio, the band recorded the
          album A Carolina Jubilee, released by Ramseur Records in 2003. <br />
          In 2004,the band released their third album, Mignonette, which
          featured polished harmonies, introspective lyrics and a sense of
          dedication that pushed the band to new heights. The album, running
          longer than 70 minutes, included vocals by the Avetts' sister Bonnie
          Avett and their father Jim Avett. <br />
          In 2005, the band released Live, Volume 2, recorded at the
          Neighborhood Theatre in Charlotte and King's Baracade in Raleigh,
          North Carolina. The album spanned material from their career up to
          that point. <br />
          In early 2006, the band released Four Thieves Gone: The Robbinsville
          Sessions to much acclaim. The album was recorded in a lake house in
          Robbinsville, North Carolina, over the course of 10 days and included
          collaborations with Paleface and Ian Thomas. <br />
          During extensive touring in support of the album Scott and Seth Avett
          produced The Gleam, an EP of intimate, stripped-down recordings, which
          was released in September 2006. They were inspired to create the album
          as a duo after their experience writing and recording "Famous Flower
          of Manhattan" during the Four Thieves Gone sessions.
        </p>
        <h3>2007–2008</h3>
        <p>
          The band released Emotionalism on May 15, 2007. It debuted at the top
          of the Billboard Top Heatseekers Albums chart, number 134 on the
          Billboard 200 and number 13 on the Independent Artist Chart. In
          support of the album the band made their national television debut on
          May 12 on Late Night with Conan O'Brien performing "Paranoia in B-Flat
          Major." Emotionalism marked the first appearance of the cellist Joe
          Kwon who has since become a full-time touring and recording member of
          the band. <br />
          On November 1, 2007 the Americana Music Association presented the
          Avett Brothers with two awards, as Duo/Group of the Year and as
          New/Emerging Artist of the Year. In July 2008, the band released The
          Second Gleam, a stripped-down acoustic album like The Gleam. In the
          same month, the band announced they had chosen Rick Rubin to produce
          their next album and were now signed to his American Recordings label.

          short videos describing their music and fans in anticipation of their
          upcoming album, I and Love and You. The videos included clips from
          past concerts, fan interviews and interviews with the members of the
          band. I and Love and You, released on September 29, 2009, peaked at
          number 16 on the Billboard 200 best-selling albums chart, number 8 on
          the best-selling digital albums chart, number 7 on the rock albums
          chart, and number 1 on the folk albums chart. <br />
          In the fall of 2010 the band released their third live album and first
          concert DVD, Live, Volume 3. The Avett Brothers performed om the 53rd
          Grammy Awards in 2011, playing "Head Full of Doubt/Road Full of
          Promise" and then joining Mumford and Sons and Bob Dylan for a
          performance of "Maggie's Farm."
        </p>

        <p>

          new album would be entitled Magpie and the Dandelion. On August 8,
          they told NPR that Magpie and the Dandelion, which consisted mostly of

        </p>
        <h3>2016–2018</h3>
        <p>
          On March 3, 2016, the band announced the expected release of their
          ninth full-length studio album, True Sadness, which Seth Avett
          described as "a patchwork quilt, both thematically and stylistically."
          The album was released on June 24, 2016 and debuted at number 3 on the
          Billboard Top 200, topping the U.S. Folk and U.S. Top Rock charts,
          though reviews were mixed. Entertainment Weekly praised the band's
          experimentation and "willingness to tear down boundaries" while
          Pitchfork criticized the "baffling layers of synthesizers in what
          feels like a ploy to push the Avetts into clear Top 40 territory." The
          album was nominated for two awards, Best Americana Album and Best
          Americana Roots Performance (the album's lead single, "Ain't No Man"),
          at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards. <br />
          On January 31, 2017, it was announced that a documentary about the
          production of True Sadness, entitled May It Last: A Portrait of the
          Avett Brothers, directed by Judd Apatow and Michael Bonfiglio, would
          premiere at the 2017 South by Southwest film festival. In October
          2016, the band was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of
          Fame. While the core four members of the band remained the same,
          however, the remaining line-up of the band continued to evolve. <br />
          In October 2018, the band debuted the song "Roses & Sacrifice" on Late
          Night with Seth Meyers, and in an interview Scott Avett stated their
          next album would release the following year, in 2019, describing the
          album as “by no means a political record, but it’s more about blatant
          social and political issues than ever before."
        </p>
        <h3>2019–present</h3>
        <p>
          On June 13,2019 the band announced that their next album would be
          titled Closer Than Together, to be released on October 4, 2019, and
          described as "informed by what is happening now." The album reached
          No. 2 on the Billboard Americana/Folk charts to mixed reviews. <br />
          In a late February 2020 interview, Scott Avett stated "we plan to at
          least have another release this year if all goes well." On June 29,
          2020, the band announced the third installment of their Gleam series,
          The Third Gleam (stylized The Gleam III) would release on August 28,
          2020. It released to generally favorable reviews and was supported by
          two drive-in concerts at the Charlotte Motor Speedway to allow social
          distancing for the COVID-19 pandemic. <br />
          The Avett Brothers released a cover of Woody Guthrie's "This Land Is
          Your Land" on Friday, October 30, four days before the 2020 United
          States presidential election. In August 2019 the band announced that a
          stage musical based on their music, titled Swept Away, would debut at
          the Berkeley Repertory Theatre in June 2020. It was postponed to 2022
          due to the pandemic, opening on January 9th.
